NOTE added 3 March, 2022. We have an improved deep mutational scanning dataset that we recommend using in place of this 2020 dataset. Please find the updated data [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS_variants/RBD-heatmaps/) and the preprint describing the new datasets [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.24.481899v1)

### Instructions
- Hover over cells with mouse to reveal additional information.
- Select site subsets using the drop down menu below the plots.
- Change which sites are displayed by brushing the zoom bar and dragging the brush.
- Clear the zoom bar by double clicking it.
- Structural visualizations of the data are available via `dms-view` [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/structures) 
- See the paper describing these data [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.012)
- Raw data available [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/blob/master/results/single_mut_effects/single_mut_effects.csv)
